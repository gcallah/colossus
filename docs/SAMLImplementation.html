        <h1>
            Current problems:
        </h1>
            <li>
                Lack information of sp: <sp_domain>, "x509cert": "", "privateKey": "" <br>
                and idp: "<idp_sso_url>", "x509cert": "<idp_cert>" <br>
                * This can probably be solved by asking Joel
            </li>

			<li>
                Original colossus uses django library for authentication when login <br>
                So I cannot modify auth_views.LoginView.as_view() to my version of authentication with SAML.
            </li>

            <li>
                I can't find colossus's connection with its database, so I am currently unable to move forward by replacing it with SAML. <br>
                And the authentication is only provided when jumping from the current login page.
            </li>

            <li>
                The colossus only checks once when open the main dashboard page for the first time which means even the session of the whole NYC expires, colossus is still accessible. <br>
                (For example, after you logging in and then close the browser for some time. When you reopen the browser, you can still access colossus unless you log out. )
            </li>

                NYCDOR's application and authentication set up. <br>
                It requires CityNet to connect and get domain name or other environment for vagrant. (I have downloaded vagrant but don't know how to apply it with external source.)
